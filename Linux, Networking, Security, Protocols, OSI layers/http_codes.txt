HTTP status codes

301 (Moved permanently): The URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently. The new URL is given in the response.

302 (Found): This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. Further changes in the URI might be made in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future requests.

404 (Not found): The server can not find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist.
